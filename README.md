# ü•ó Smart Food Recommendation API (NutriClime)

This is the backend of the **Smart Food Choice Application**, developed for the **Samsung Solve for Tomorrow Hackathon**. The app helps users make better food choices by recommending meals based on:

- Their **medical conditions** (e.g., diabetes, hypertension)
- The **current weather conditions** at their location

---

## üöÄ Features

- User registration with medical condition tracking
- Real-time weather integration using location data
- Intelligent food recommendations powered by AI and weather context
- Modular REST API built with Express and PostgreSQL (via Prisma ORM)

---

## üß† Backend Logic Overview

1. **User & Medical Data**  
   Each user has a unique `userId`. Medical conditions are stored for that user and can be retrieved or updated.

2. **Weather Integration**  
   Using geolocation (`latitude`, `longitude`), the backend fetches current weather data (e.g., sunny, humid, cold).

3. **Food Recommendation Engine**  
   The app uses:
   - Medical conditions
   - Weather data  
   to generate healthy food options (optionally powered by an AI like **Gemini API**).
